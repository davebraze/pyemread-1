This is a general purpose, stand-alone software package designed for assisting single/multi-line text reading experiments and analyzing collected eye movement data. The package consists of a series of functions to generate bitmaps of single/multi-line texts for reading, extract and visualize saccades and fixations detected by eye trackers during reading, and calculate regional summaries of widely-adopted eye-movement measures used in reading research.
