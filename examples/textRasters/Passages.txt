# The Descent (166 words)
Alex and Tim are lost.  Alex's wife recently passed away and he couldn't
find the motivation to live a normal life. Tim has been charged with
embezzlement and is going to prison soon. The thought of that terrified
him. They decided to take a ride down the river rapids at Cataract Canyon.
A river only goes one way. If you are lost, that is good. Alex has never
rafted on this river before, but Tim has many times. Tim tells Alex that
the rapids can be a dangerous place.  Boats can overturn and people fall
in.  Concerned, Alex asks a river guide for advice. The guide tells him
"sometimes things don't go as planned on the river, and they turn for the
worst. You find yourself struggling, fighting against the force of the
river. When that happens in nature, it's best to surrender. You'd never
hear a football coach tell you that, to surrender, but on the river it's
okay."

# Beauty Forever (99 words)
The trial pack of Beauty-Forever pills made the couple feel more attractive
than either had ever imagined possible. Suddenly their marriage was filled
with more laughter, more cuddling, more passionate sex more often.
Convinced, they became loyal customers. One day, lying in bed, their
seemingly perfect bodies naked and spent together, the wife said, "Did you
think I was beautiful before?" The husband said, "Of course I did." She
replied, "Then let's stop taking the pills. Let's see each other as we
really are." The husband looked at her, radiant beside him and said,
"Maybe tomorrow, dear. Maybe tomorrow."

# A Run to Remember (191 words)
Cowboy was without a doubt the ugliest horse in the world. Even so, I
loved him beyond all reason. I realized that my only chance to compete
would be in the speed events, since events based on appearance were out of
the question. I chose barrel racing and came in next to last, while Becky,
who rode a big brown thoroughbred mare, won every time. For the whole next
month I woke up early every day and rode Cowboy five miles to the arena and
trained. On the way home from the arena, I would be so tired; those five
miles seemed twice as long. In the following competition, I sat at the gate
while I watched Becky and her horse race through the course with ease. My
turn finally came. At the signal, we dashed toward the first barrel,
whipped around it and with perfect precision rounded the second and the
third. When we passed the finish line, the crowd was silent. We had beaten
Becky and her thoroughbred! I realized then that no matter what the odds,
I'd always come out a winner if I worked hard for it.
